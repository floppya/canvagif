canvagif
========

canvagif is a tool for recording a sequence of images from a
webpage element. The name reflects that its main purpose is
for recording canvas elements.

Requirements
============
canvagif is based on PyQt4. I've only tested this in win7 but
it ought to work wherever PyQt works.

Usage
=====
* Run the 'start.bat', 'start.sh', or 'src/main.py' depending on
your system
* Navigate to the page you want to record using the address bar
and clicking
* Click 'Select element' in the recording pane
* Hover over the element you want to select and click
* Adjust fps, output size, and location as you'd like.
* Click record
* When you're done recording, click the 'stop recording' button
* The image sequence should now be in the target output directory
* Use some other tool to package the images into an animation
format of your choosing
